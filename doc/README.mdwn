LVM2 Wiki Documentation
=======================

If you are looking for information about LVM2 visit the [[Index]] page,

There are only some notes about writing stuff under *./doc* here:

* If possible use [[MarkDown]] for formatting, use *.md* (or *.mdwn*) suffix.
* For linking between files, use [[IkiWiki]] syntax `[[FileName]]` or
  `[[FileName#Anchor]]`, or `[[link text|FileName]]`

Markdown 
--------

* Use `<!-- comment -->` to keep notes, which will not be rendered.
* Use `[[TODO]]` for anything what needs attention. This will be accessible
  through the linked [[TODO]] page.

IkiWiki
-------

* Install ikiwiki:

      yum install ikiwiki

* To generate the content, run following in the LVM2 top directory:

      ikiwiki --setup ikiwiki.setup

Internal Stuff:
---------------

* [[TODO]] Can we have a section which is hidden by default? Like this one?
* [[TODO]] Add basic IkiWiki and MarkDown How To.
